Enviormental Tracking Buoy. This buoy is designed to read air temperature, water temperature, humditiy and wind speed. 
The main script for the sensor readings are in the python file named PiTemp.py. 
The main webpage is split into three different files, index.php, history.php and aboutus.php. 
index.php shows the main dashboard with current records retreived from the buoy.history.php 
shows all the information retreived from the buoy in scrollable tables as well as includes Google Charts
to display line graphs of the data retreived. filter.php incorperates the date picker on the history page. 
Finally, aboutus.php tells the user more about the project.
